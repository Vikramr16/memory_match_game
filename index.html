                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Cash is an asset. When cash comes into the business, we 'Debit' the Cash Account. Capital is the owner's investment, which is a liability for the business, and liabilities increase with a 'Credit'."
            },
            {
                question: "2. Rent paid in cash",

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Rent is an expense for the business. As a rule, all expenses are 'Debited' to increase them. The cash account would be 'Credited' to show a decrease in the asset (cash)."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Mr. A is a debtor who owes the business money, so he is an asset. Since assets increase with a 'Debit', we 'Debit' Mr. A's account. The Sales account, which is an income account, would be 'Credited' because incomes increase with a 'Credit'."
            },

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "Machinery is an asset. When an asset is purchased, we 'Debit' the asset account (Machinery). The payment is made by cheque, so the Bank account is 'Credited' as the asset (bank balance) decreases."

                correct: 1,
                explanation: "Sales returns are a decrease in sales. Since sales are normally 'Credited', sales returns, which reduce sales, are 'Debited'. The customer's account would be 'Credited' to reduce the amount they owe the business."

                correct: 2,
                explanation: "When you receive rent in advance, it's considered unearned income, which is a liability. Liabilities increase with a 'Credit'. The cash account would be 'Debited' to show the increase in cash."

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "Drawings are funds or goods withdrawn by the owner for personal use. They are considered a reduction of capital, so we 'Debit' the Drawings account. Cash would be 'Credited'."

                correct: 0,
                explanation: "When a debtor pays you, the amount they owe you decreases. Since debtors are assets, a decrease in asset is 'Credited'. The Cash/Bank account would be 'Debited' as cash increases."
